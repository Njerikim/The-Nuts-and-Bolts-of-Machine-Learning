Welcome to The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning — a hands-on repository where I dive deep into the core principles, algorithms, and real-world applications of Machine Learning.

This space contains my projects, experiments, notes, and implementations as I continue exploring and mastering the art and science of ML — from foundational algorithms to advanced models.

🚀 What You’ll Find Here

Each folder in this repo represents a focused topic, concept, or project related to machine learning.

Category	Description
🧩 Supervised Learning	Projects on regression, classification, and feature engineering.
🌲 Ensemble Methods	Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Bagging experiments.
🤖 Unsupervised Learning	Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN), PCA, dimensionality reduction.
🧮 Mathematical Foundations	Linear algebra, statistics, and optimization essentials.
🧠 Deep Learning	Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and transfer learning projects.
🧾 Real-World Applications	Case studies using real datasets (finance, healthcare, NLP, etc.).
